# Idea

# Method 1
Use the charater of python and treat the integer as a string. Return the result whether it is equal to its reverse.

# Method 2
Compare with zero to eliminate negative, then use a loop to reverse the number.

# Thoughts
Maybe use the idea of double pointer and compare each other on the end.
